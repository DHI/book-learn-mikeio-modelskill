# Getting started with Dfs files in Python using MIKE IO

## Who should attend?

The course has been designed for MIKE modelers with some previous experience with programming or scripting, e.g. Python, Matlab, R, C# or Fortran. 

## Content

The course comprises typical data processing tasks in connection with MIKE modelling, extracting selected data for analysis, preparing time series input data (forcing, boundary condition) for simulations etc. We will use Jupyter notebooks with Python packages such as NumPy, pandas and MIKE IO.

## Benefits

After the course you will have improved your skills and knowledge on how to more efficiently read, write and perform data analysis on data stored in dfs files using Python.
