# Python for marine modelers using MIKE IO and ModelSkill

Would you like to use Python to become more efficient as a marine modeler?

## Who should attend?

This course has been designed for MIKE 21/3 modelers with some Python experience, e.g. from the course [Getting started with dfs files in Python using MIKE IO](https://dhi.github.io/getting-started-with-mikeio/) or similar, that would like to use Python for more pre- and post-processing. 

:::{note}
This course assumes that you are familiar with Python!
:::

## Content

The course comprises typical data processing tasks in connection with MIKE 21/3 modelling, preparing input data, converting forcing data from other formats, creating roughness maps, concatenating files, extracting data from output files (e.g. vertical profiles), visualization, assessing the skill of MIKE 21/3 by comparing to station and satellite track observation data. We will use Jupyter notebooks with Python packages such as NumPy, pandas and xarray as well DHI's own [MIKE IO](https://github.com/DHI/mikeio) and [ModelSkill](https://github.com/DHI/modelskill) packages. 

## Benefits

After the course, you will have improved your skills and knowledge on

* Mesh and dfsu file formats
* How to conduct typical MIKE 21/3 modeling workflows using MIKE IO
   - How to prepare inputs for MIKE 21/3 models (convert, extract etc)
   - How to analyse and visualise model outputs
   - How to extract and export data to other formats
* How to do MIKE 21/3 model skill assessment with ModelSkill
   - Simple 1-1 comparisons
   - Many-to-many comparisons 
   - Flexible aggregated statistics with a variety of metrics
